Oryx 2 is a realization of the lambda architecture built on [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org)
and [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org), but with specialization for real-time large scale machine
learning. It is a framework for building applications, but also includes packaged, end-to-end
applications for collaborative filtering, classification, regression and clustering.

Oryx 2 is a rearchitecting and continuation of the original [Oryx 1](http://github.com/cloudera/oryx)
project.

It consists of three _tiers_, each of which builds on the one below:

1. A generic lambda architecture tier, providing batch/speed/serving layers, which is not
specific to machine learning
1. A specialization on top providing ML abstractions for hyperparameter selection, etc.
1. An end-to-end implementation of the same standard ML algorithms as an application
  ([ALS](http://labs.yahoo.com/files/HuKorenVolinsky-ICDM08.pdf),
[random decision forests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest),
[k-means](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)) on top

Viewed another way, it contains the three side-by-side cooperating _layers_ of the lambda
architecture too, as well as a connecting element:

1. A *Batch Layer*, which computes a new "result" (think model, but, could be anything)
as a function of all historical data, and the previous result. This may be a long-running operation
which takes hours, and runs a few times a day for example.
2. A *Speed Layer*, which produces and publishes incremental model updates from a
stream of new data. These updates are intended to happen on the order of seconds.
3. A *Serving Layer*, which receives models and updates and implements a synchronous API exposing
query operations on the result.
4. A data transport layer, which moves data between layers and receives input from external sources

The project may be reused tier by tier: for example, the packaged app tier can be ignored, and it
can be a framework for building new ML applications. It can be reused layer by layer too:
for example, the Speed Layer can be omitted if a deployment does not need incremental updates.
It can be modified piece-by-piece too: the collaborative filtering application's model-building
batch layer could be swapped for a custom implementation based on a new algorithm outside
Spark MLlib while retaining the serving and speed layer implementations.

# Lambda Tier Implementation

## Data transport

The data transport mechanism is an [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) topic.
Any process -- including but not limited to the serving layer -- can put data onto the topic,
to be seen by the speed and batch layers. Kafka topics are also used to publish both
*models* and *model updates*, for consumption by the speed and serving layers.

## Batch Layer

The batch layer is implemented as a [Spark Streaming](http://spark.apache.org/streaming/)
process on a Hadoop cluster, which reads data from the input Kafka topic. The Streaming process
necessarily has a very long period -- hours or even a day. It uses Spark to save the
current window of data to HDFS, and then combine with all historical data on HDFS, and
initiate building of a new result. The result is written to HDFS, and, also published
to a Kafka update topic.

## Speed Layer

The speed layer is implemented as a Spark Streaming process as well, which also listens for
data from the input Kafka topic. It has a much shorter period, on the order of seconds.
It periodically loads a new model from the update topic and continually produces model updates.
These are put back onto the update topic too.

## Serving Layer

The serving layer listens for model and model updates on the update topic. It maintains model
state in memory. It exposes an HTTP
[REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API on top of methods
that query the model in memory. Many of these may be deployed for scale. Each may
also accept new data and write it to Kafka where it can be seen by the Speed and Batch layers.

## Usage and Deployment

The application is written in Java, using [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) 1.3.x+,
[Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) 2.6.x+, [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) 8.x+,
[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) 0.8.2+, [Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) and more. Configuration uses a single
[Typesafe Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config) config file, wherein
applications configure an entire deployment of the system. This includes implementations of
key interface classes which implement the batch, speed, and serving logic. Applications
package and deploy their implementations with each instance of the layer binaries. Each
of these is a runnable Java `.jar` which starts all necessary services.

# ML Tier Implementation

The ML tier is simply an implementation and specialization of the generic interfaces mentioned
above, which implement common ML needs and then expose a different ML-specific interface for
applications to fill in.

For example, it implements a batch layer update process that selects a test and training set
automatically. It calls an app-supplied function to evaluate the model on the test set.
It can automatically repeat this, and with different hyperparameter values, choosing the best
result. It manages serialization of the model via
[PMML](http://www.dmg.org/v4-2-1/GeneralStructure.html).

# End-to-end Application Implementation

In addition to being a framework, Oryx 2 contains complete implementations of the batch, speed and
serving layer for three machine learning use cases. These are ready to deploy out-of-the-box, or to be
used as the basis for a custom application:

- Collaborative filtering / recommendation based on Alternating Least Squares
- Clustering based on k-means
- Classification and regression based on random decision forests
