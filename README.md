Oryx 2 is a realization of the lambda architecture built on [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) 
and [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org), but with specialization for real-time large scale machine 
learning. It is a framework for building applications, but also includes packaged, end-to-end 
applications for collaborative filtering, classification, regression and clustering.

Proceed to the [Oryx 2 site](http://oryx.io/) for full documentation.

Just looking to deploy a ready-made, end-to-end application for collaborative filtering, clustering or classification? Easy.
Proceed directly to:

- Prepare your Hadoop cluster with [Cluster Setup](http://oryx.io/docs/index.html#Cluster_Setup)
- Get a [Release](https://github.com/OryxProject/oryx/releases)
- Prepare a config file from the [Configuration Reference](http://oryx.io/docs/index.html#Configuration)
- Run the binaries with [Running Oryx](http://oryx.io/docs/index.html#Running)
- Learn about the REST API endpoints you can call in the [API Endpoint Reference](http://oryx.io/docs/index.html#API_Endpoint_Reference)

Developers can consume Oryx 2 as a framework for building custom applications as well. 
Following the architecture overview below, proceed to 
[Making an Oryx App](http://oryx.io/docs/index.html#Making_an_Oryx_App) 
to learn how to create a new application.
